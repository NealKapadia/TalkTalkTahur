"""
BlinkTalk - shared signal processing and feature extraction.

The SAME code runs on the laptop (training) and on the SK-AM62B (inference),
so features always match. Only numpy + scipy are needed.

Pipeline:
  1. Load AFE4950 ECG-channel export (CSV: time_s, volts) -> millivolts
  2. 60 Hz notch (Q=30) + 2nd-order 10 Hz low-pass Butterworth (zero phase)
  3. Candidate events = rising and falling slope peaks above 6 x robust
     noise level, each at least 0.30 s from the previous one of its kind
  4. One feature vector per candidate from a window -0.4 s .. +0.8 s
  5. Quality gate: candidates whose window runs off the recording are dropped
